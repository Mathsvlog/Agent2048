2048: An AI Agent

1 Introduction
Game playing is a very interesting topic area in Artificial Intelligence today. Specifically, the game 2048 is a great strategy game to which AI principles can be applied. It is straight- forward to emulate gameplay and quantify results. Further, as it is a very difficult game for humans to win, we are interested in noting how much better a computer can perform against humans. All utility is received at the point when a 2048 tile is achieved, and there are no intermediary rewards. Further, as the computer only adds a random element, it is not adversarial. As this is not a classic two-player zero sum game, it is again more novel.
